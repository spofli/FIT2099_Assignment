Stormtroopers are nameless SWActors
Stormtroopers act()consist of:
(25%)try to attack (75% chance to fail) -> (5%) try to call for backup -> move
Stormtroopers can be mindcontrolled as they are weak minded

Calling for backup was implemented as an action so that Stormtroopers can schedule it.
A new function is made in SWWorld so to complement the CallBackup action.
The callbackup action creates a new stormtrooper and calls the function in SWWorld to access the SWEntitiy manager and place it into the world.
